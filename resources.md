I think the most prominent example of ML right now is Alpha Go beating a world champion (http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/12/11210650/alphago-deepmind-go-match-3-result).

This site (http://setosa.io/ev/) provides visual explanations to some ML concepts.

Flowing data (http://flowingdata.com/) always has some nice visualizations.

This (http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) is supposed to be a visual introduction to ML, but really more explains decision trees.

I try to keep a list of resources (http://learningwithdata.com/resources/) but there are definitely updates I need to make.

There are some pretty cool computer vision examples online (https://www.clarifai.com/#demo) and (http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/demo.html)

There are also some sites that try to provide guides on how to learn ML: (http://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) and (http://datasciencemasters.org/)
